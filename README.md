# API
Included in this repository:
A locally hosted API capable of sending and receiving data in XML and JSON formats.
A database for the API to insert data into and pull data from.
A basic app which can visualize the data.
IMPORTANT: The API uses absolute paths to validate XML and JSON, you will have to change these paths in order for validation to work. They are marked with a TODO.
To run the application, start the API first, THEN launch the app. The app will NOT start if the API isn't available.
